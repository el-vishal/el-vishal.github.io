      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s all about the balance - don&amp;rsquo;t you think so? Think about it.. Extremes have always lead to worst experiences..
Too stubborn? no! Too modest? no!
Too arrogant? hell no! Too helpful? ah that&amp;rsquo;s too much!
Workholic? eww! Yolo? grr!
Greedy? jail! Generous? cottage!
Reminds me of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Golden Mean all virtues lie at a mean between extremes of deficiency and excess. Golden mean is an approach to ethics that emphasizes finding the appropriate medium, or middle ground, between extremes</description>

      <title>Your growth stops when your hustle stops</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t you think so?
When you relax, you stop..
When you cherish entertainment, you stop..
When you go away, you stop..
While everything you do can give you inspirations, aspirations and different perceptions; the growth in your specialisation, still stops?
Would any &amp;lt;sports_player&amp;gt; be that &amp;lt;sports_player&amp;gt; if he had stopped?
Maybe you can have it all if you only care about one thing in your life. One for each of the pivoting/defining desires of yourself.</description>
