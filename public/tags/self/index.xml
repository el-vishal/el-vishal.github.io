      <description>Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know the secret to success? Working towards anything gets you closer to success. You know it, I know it, I think all know it?
And perhaps we all even know what we need to work on to reach there.. Fitness? Eat healthy and exercise Dream Job? Prove your skills Leave a habit? Stay distracted from it Make friends? Be between people
Why do we not do it then? Are we just too weak and lazy?</description>

      <description>Girls prioritise feelings, emotions, pamper and gentleness. [FEPG] Boys prioritise career, ambitions, confidence and boldness. [CACD] While girl love above attributes from guys, at the end of the day they want FEPG from them. At the same time while guys like those girl attributes, they love to see the CACD behaviour from their partner.
Reminds me one of the Osho&amp;rsquo;s teachings:
While men is trying to go to the other planets, the moon.</description>

      <title>All about the balance</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s all about the balance - don&amp;rsquo;t you think so? Think about it.. Extremes have always lead to worst experiences..
Too stubborn? no! Too modest? no!
Too arrogant? hell no! Too helpful? ah that&amp;rsquo;s too much!
Workholic? eww! Yolo? grr!
Greedy? jail! Generous? cottage!
Reminds me of Aristotle&amp;rsquo;s Golden Mean all virtues lie at a mean between extremes of deficiency and excess. Golden mean is an approach to ethics that emphasizes finding the appropriate medium, or middle ground, between extremes</description>

      <title>Your growth stops when your hustle stops</title>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t you think so?
When you relax, you stop..
When you cherish entertainment, you stop..
When you go away, you stop..
While everything you do can give you inspirations, aspirations and different perceptions; the growth in your specialisation, still stops?
Would any &amp;lt;sports_player&amp;gt; be that &amp;lt;sports_player&amp;gt; if he had stopped?
Maybe you can have it all if you only care about one thing in your life. One for each of the pivoting/defining desires of yourself.</description>
